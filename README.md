# Next.js 13 Application

This project is built with **Next.js 13**, utilizing the **Pages Router** and **Route Handlers** for routing and API management. It integrates a range of powerful libraries and tools, including **Redux Toolkit** for state management, **Material UI 7** for UI components, **React Hook Form** with **Yup** for form handling and validation, **Formidable** for image uploads, **Axios** for making HTTP requests, and **Bun** as the development toolkit for enhanced performance.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a solution for a **coding challenge**. The application demonstrates the integration of several modern web development tools and practices, including state management, form validation, image upload handling, and more.

## Libraries and Tools Used

### 1. [Next.js 13 (Pages Router & Route Handler)](https://nextjs.org/docs)

This project uses **Next.js 13** with the **Pages Router** for routing and **Route Handlers** for handling API endpoints.

### 2. [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

State management is handled by **Redux Toolkit** using `createAsyncThunk` for managing asynchronous actions in the application.

### 3. [Material UI 7](https://mui.com/)

The UI components are built using **Material UI 7**, providing a modern and responsive design system.

### 4. [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

Form handling and validation are managed using **React Hook Form**, with **Yup** integrated for schema-based validation.

### 5. [Formidable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable)

**Formidable** is used to handle file uploads, such as images, on the server side.

### 6. [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

HTTP requests are handled by **Axios**, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

### 7. [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

**Yup** is used for schema-based validation of form data, integrated with **React Hook Form** for seamless validation in the application.

### 8. [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

**Bun** is used as the development toolkit, providing faster builds and improved performance during development.
